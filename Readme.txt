**Python CLI Typing Practice Trainer

A command-line based typing improvement application written in Python. This project provides a structured typing practice environment with 10 progressive levels, each designed to help users develop typing accuracy, speed, and muscle memory. It includes typing-speed measurement (WPM), accuracy calculation, and interactive real-time user input — all inside a minimal CLI experience.

->Features

    -10 levels of incremental typing difficulty

    -Interactive CLI interface

    -WPM (Words Per Minute) calculation

    -Accuracy scoring per level

    -Level-based progression (60% accuracy required to pass)

    -Clean UI with formatted instructions

    -Fully offline — runs locally

    -Beginner-friendly Python code (readable & modular)

->Concept & Purpose

Typing is one of the most important skills for programmers, writers, and general computer users. This tool allows users to practice typing through progressively challenging textual passages, ensuring improvement in both accuracy and typing speed.

This project originated from a manually designed typing application and has since been redesigned thoughtfully to promote better structure, code clarity, and expandability — maintaining ease-of-use while adding improved functionality and refinement.

->Tech Stack
    -Technology	Usage
    -Python 3.x	Core programming language
    -time module	WPM & timing analysis
    -Built-in CLI input/output	User interaction

    -No third-party packages required.

->How to Run
    -python typing_practice.py


     or

    -python3 typing_practice.py


    -No dependencies — it just runs!

->Project Structure (Simple Overview)
    -main.py                    # main executable script
    -README.md                  # project documentation

->How It Works

    -User starts the app from terminal

    -App displays instructions

    -User types displayed sentences

    -Application measures:

    -correctness

    -typing speed (WPM)

    -overall accuracy

    -If accuracy >= 60%, user advances

    -Completing all 10 levels finishes the challenge
